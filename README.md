Neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington disease (HD) are characterized by the deterioration of neuronal structure. According to relevant literature, NDD may result in a variety of clinical symptoms that impair gait dynamics. Gait analysis is essential for early diagnosis, effective treatment planning, and tracking the course of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. In this repository, the [gaitndd](https://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/database/gaitndd/) dataset from Physionet has been used. This dataset consists of 64 one-minute recordings of Compound Force Signal (CFS) from 13 patients with ALS, 15 patients with PD, 20 patients with HD, and 16 healthy people. CFS is the combination of force signals for the subject's left and right foot during walking. In this work, CFS was decomposed using a 6-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with several wavelets to determine its characteristics. Using the means of 20 trials for five-fold cross-validation (FFCV) in Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Nave Bayesian Classifier, the acquired features were analyzed (NBC).

It is a class project for the Biomedical Signal Processing course that has been implemented based on this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809416301173?via%3Dihub)
